## this file contains metadata information for genomes under analysis
## for a complete description of currently supported features, please
## take a look into "User_guide.txt". In brief:

#GENOME - genome file name (e.g "Homo_sapiens.gb" means that SIGNATURES will look for a file with this name in the input directory)

#STRANDEDNESS - either "single" or "double" to indicate if an organism's genome is composed of single- or double-stranded DNA/RNA

#GROUP - group to be used for summarizing results and for label colouring in heatmaps

GENOME	STRANDEDNESS	GROUP
